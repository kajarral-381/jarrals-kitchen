## How to Use the New Menu Structure

### For Developers

- Use `spiceLevel` to indicate heat level with appropriate UI elements

### For UI/UX
- Display `prepTime` to set customer expectations
- Use `calories` for nutritional information
- Use `spiceLevel` to show heat indicators (e.g., chili icons)
- Group items by `category` for organized menu sections
- Use `servingInfo` to clearly communicate portion sizes and what's included
- Highlight bulk purchase options from `servingInfo.boxOption` or `servingInfo.fullCake`

### For Business Analysis
