In a real project, you would have actual image files here. For this demo, we're using placeholder references.

The following images would be needed:
1. hero-bakery.jpg - A hero image of a bakery storefront or interior
2. chocolate-croissant.jpg - Image of a chocolate croissant
3. strawberry-cheesecake.jpg - Image of a strawberry cheesecake
4. sourdough-bread.jpg - Image of sourdough bread
5. blueberry-muffin.jpg - Image of a blueberry muffin
6. cinnamon-roll.jpg - Image of a cinnamon roll
7. baguette.jpg - Image of a baguette
8. chocolate-cake.jpg - Image of a chocolate cake
9. apple-pie.jpg - Image of an apple pie
10. chocolate-chip-cookie.jpg - Image of chocolate chip cookies

12. baker-jane.jpg - Photo of baker Jane
13. baker-michael.jpg - Photo of baker Michael
14. baker-emily.jpg - Photo of baker Emily

For a real website, you would:
1. Use actual high-quality images
2. Optimize them for web (compress, proper dimensions)
3. Consider using a CDN for better performance
4. Implement lazy loading for images
